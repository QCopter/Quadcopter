Description
-----------

The code contained within this repository is intended to act as the complete control system for a X-configuration
quadcopter with 6-axis sensor capability. Specifically, the code is written for compatability with the LSM303DLHC 
Accel+Compass and the Osepp MPU3000/MPU3050 gyro.


Features and long term goals:
----------------------------
   <br />
  - Fully autonomous flight and landing. Has the option to be controlled via radio comms. <br />

  - 6 DOF Sensor capability, upgrade to 9 DOF including magnetometer module.  <br />
  
  - Obstacle avoidance and tracking, mapping cabalilities  <br />
  
  - Open source =]
   <br />
   <br />

Under development currently:
----------------------------

 <br />
  - Sensor noise reduction - DONE, unless we find out later it's still too noisy. <br />

  - Smooth motor control. <br />

  - Assembly with all 4 motors. <br />
