Description
-----------

The code contained within this repository is intended to act as the complete control system for a + configuration
quadcopter with 9-DOF sensor capability. Specifically, the code is written for compatability with the LSM303DLHC 
Accel+Compass and the Osepp MPU3000/MPU3050 gyro.

Under development currently:
----------------------------

 <br />
  - Digital filtering of accel and gyro data <br />

  - GPS integration and datalogging <br />
      - See [QCopterMain.ino](https://github.com/briches/Quadcopter/blob/master/QCopterMain/QCopterMain.ino) for info. <br />


Features and long term goals:
----------------------------
   <br />
  - Fully autonomous takeoff and landing. Has the option to be controlled via radio comms. <br />

  - 9DOF sensor module (IMU) with GPS and localization  <br />
  
  - Open source =]
