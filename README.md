Description
-----------

Its quadcopter flight software! 

Our end goal is to create future proof, easy-to-use 
and customizable firmware for any flight configuration ( which is quite the lofty goal, but we're working on it).
<br /><br />

MCU: Osepp Mega 2560 R3   
(A port to the chipKIT uC32 with the PIC32 is underway)

<br />
Current sensors lineup:
 - LSM303 Accelerometer / Magnetometer 
 - MPU3050 Gyro
 - Adafruit ultimate GPS module
 - RTC Module (DS1307)
 - Maxbotix USRF (LV-EZ1)
 - BMP085 Barometeric Pressure/Temperature/Altitude
 

Under development currently:
----------------------------

 <br />
  - Hardware PWM implementation

  - Formatting changes to allow greater abstraction

  - GPS integration and datalogging <br />


Features and long term goals:
----------------------------
   <br />
  - Fully autonomous takeoff and landing. Has the option to be controlled via radio comms. <br />

  - 9DOF sensor module (IMU) with GPS and localization  <br />
  
  - Open source =]
